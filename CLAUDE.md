- [x] Created Deep Research Agent with mock and real search providers
- [x] Set up RQ job queue for async processing
- [x] Built React frontend with real-time updates via polling
- [x] Created Docker Compose setup for full deployment
- [x] Added comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [x] Generated API documentation and Postman collection
- [x] Created ERD diagram in Mermaid format
- [x] Wrote comprehensive README with setup instructions

### Deliverables Completed
- ✅ Full-stack application with vertical slice
- ✅ Data models: Campaigns → Companies → People → Context Snippets
- ✅ Deep Research Agent with iterative search (3 iterations max)
- ✅ Dual interfaces: REST API + React Web UI
- ✅ Real-time progress updates (polling-based, WebSocket-ready)
- ✅ Docker Compose deployment
- ✅ Comprehensive testing suite
- ✅ API collection for Postman/Insomnia
- ✅ ERD diagram and documentation

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- Database: PostgreSQL with JSONB for research data
- Queue: RQ (Redis Queue) for async job processing
- Frontend: React + Vite + Axios
- Deployment: Docker Compose multi-service setup
- Real-time: Polling (WebSocket endpoints ready for future upgrade)

## Key Features Implemented
1. ✅ Data models: Campaigns → Companies → People → Context Snippets + Search Logs
2. ✅ Deep Research Agent with iterative search (mock + SerpAPI support)
3. ✅ Dual interfaces: REST API + React Web UI
4. ✅ Real-time progress updates with job status tracking
5. ✅ Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
6. ✅ JSON Schema validation for research payloads
7. ✅ Pluggable search providers (mock/real)
8. ✅ Seed data with sample Campaign → Company → People
9. ✅ Complete audit trail via search logs

## Commands
- Start: `docker-compose up -d`
- Test: `cd backend && pytest`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Backend: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Worker: `cd backend && python app/worker.py`
- Migrations: `cd backend && alembic upgrade head`

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All requirements from requirements.md have been successfully implemented. The platform is ready for deployment and testing.
